## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smartflix-ml-recommender.git
   cd smartflix-ml-recommender

2. **Install the required packages**
   
3. **Explore the data and models**  
- Use the `notebooks/` directory to begin with EDA or experiments.
- Place any datasets in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the backend server
## Using Uvicorn (FastAPI)
python -m uvicorn src.server:app --reload

## Using simple HTTP server (for frontend static files)
python -m http.server 5500


Backend API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000

Frontend (if static HTML/CSS/JS) will run at http://127.0.0.1:5500
